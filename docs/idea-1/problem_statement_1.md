### 2. Problem Statement (max. 5 sentences)

Students across various university courses often struggle to efficiently locate specific information within a multitude of course materials like lecture slides, research papers, and textbooks. This application aims to solve this by providing a centralized, intelligent query interface for any uploaded course resources. Its main functionality is to allow users to upload diverse course documents (e.g., PDFs, Markdown files, text files) and then ask natural language questions about the content. The intended users are students enrolled in any university or online course seeking a faster way to find information and understand complex topics, ultimately saving significant study time and improving comprehension of their study materials. GenAI will be meaningfully integrated using LangChain and a vector database to implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling the assistant to answer user queries based *only* on the provided course-specific documents, with support for both cloud-based (e.g., OpenAI API) and local Large Language Models (LLMs).


### 3. High-Level Functional Points

* User can sign up, log in, and manage their profile (e.g., associate with specific courses).
* User can create "course spaces" or collections to organize materials.
* User can upload various document types (PDF, MD, TXT) into a selected course space.
* System efficiently processes and indexes uploaded documents, making them immediately available for querying.
* System provides clear feedback to the user during document upload, processing, and indexing stages (e.g., progress indicators, success/error messages).
* User can ask natural language questions within the context of a specific course space.
* The GenAI backend retrieves relevant information from the indexed documents (RAG) and generates a concise answer.
* The application displays the answer along with citations or references to the source document(s) and page numbers/sections.
* (Optional) Admin dashboard to view system usage statistics or manage global settings.

### 4. Scenarios 


#### üìò Scenario 1: Studying for an Exam  

**User**: Sarah, a biology major
**Use Case**: Sarah is preparing for her midterm exam and needs to quickly review concepts from her genetics lectures.
##### Workflow:

1. Sarah logs in and enters her ‚ÄúBiology 101‚Äù course space.
2. She uploads her lecture slides (PDF), a textbook chapter (PDF), and class notes (TXT).
3. The system processes the documents and confirms they‚Äôre ready for querying.
4. The system provides two learning interfaces: flashcards and Q&A. Sarah selects the Q&A interface.
4. Sarah types: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the difference between mitosis and meiosis?‚Äù
5. The app responds with a concise, clear answer and cites the specific slide and page in her textbook.

---
Sarah uses the assistant to quickly review concepts from her genetics lecture materials before a midterm.


#### üìÇ Scenario 2: Reviewing Across Multiple Materials 
**User**: John, a computer science student
**Use Case**: John wants to understand recursion better, as it‚Äôs covered in both her slides and textbook.

---

##### Workflow:

1. He uploads his lecture slides and textbook into her ‚ÄúData Structures‚Äù course space.
2. He selects the Q&A interface.
2. He asks: ‚ÄúCan you explain recursion with an example?‚Äù
3. The system retrieves relevant content from both the slide deck and textbook, combines insights, and outputs a synthesized explanation with citations to both sources.
4. John feels confident after reading the example provided and follows the links to explore the material further.

---
John asks a question about recursion and gets a combined explanation from both his slides and textbook.


### üß† Scenario 3: Generating Flashcards for Active Recall

**User**: Elena, a psychology student
**Use Case**: Elena wants to create flashcards from her lecture materials to help her memorize key theories and definitions for an upcoming quiz.

--- 

##### Workflow:

1. Elena logs into her account and selects the ‚ÄúCognitive Psychology‚Äù course space.
2. She uploads a set of lecture slides and a PDF summary of core psychological theories.
3. After processing, she clicks on the new feature tab: ‚ÄúGenerate Flashcards.‚Äù
4. The assistant asks if she wants:
    - ‚úÖ Flashcards aIuto-generated from the documents
    - ‚úçÔ∏è Flashcards based on a specific topic or keyword she types
5. She selects auto-generation and optionally sets filters like:
    - *Focus on definitions and key terms*
    - *Limit to 20 cards*
6. The GenAI backend processes the chunks and creates Q&A pairs, like:
    - **Q:** What is cognitive dissonance?
      **A:** The psychological discomfort experienced when holding two conflicting beliefs or values.
    - **Q:** Who proposed the stages of cognitive development?
      **A:** Jean Piaget.
7. Elena reviews the cards, edits or deletes any she doesn‚Äôt like, and saves the final deck to her account.
8. She can now:
   - üîÅ **Review** the flashcards in-app using a quiz mode (randomized, flipped cards)
   - üì§ **Export** them (e.g., to Anki, PDF, or CSV)
   - üë• **Share** the deck with classmates in the same course space

---
Elena auto-generates a deck of flashcards from her psychology documents to prepare for a quiz using active recall.



### 4. Initial System Structure (Text and Diagram)

* **Server:** Spring Boot REST API handling user authentication, document management (uploads, storage metadata), course space management, and orchestrating communication with the GenAI service. It will be architected with at least 3 microservices (e.g., User & Course Service, Document Processing Service, Query Orchestration Service).
* **Client:** A responsive web frontend (React/Angular/Vue.js) providing the user interface for login, document upload, course space management, and the interactive chat/Q&A interface.
* **GenAI Service:** A Python-based microservice utilizing LangChain. It will handle document chunking, embedding generation, interaction with a vector database (e.g., Weaviate or similar) for storing and querying document embeddings, and communication with LLMs (OpenAI API and a local model like Ollama) to generate answers via RAG.
* **Database:** A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL, run via Docker) for storing user data, course space information, document metadata, and other application-specific data. The vector database will store the document embeddings.


### 5. Pros & Cons

* **Pros:**
    * Addresses a common and significant pain point for students across many disciplines.
    * Provides a clear and valuable application of GenAI (RAG) for information retrieval.
    * The domain is flexible, allowing the team to use their own course materials for testing.
    * The technical requirements align well with the specified project stack.
    * Can lead to a highly useful tool for personal study or broader student use.
    * A key differentiator will be its highly intuitive, student-centric user experience and robust citation features specifically tailored for academic materials, going beyond generic document Q&A.
* **Cons:**
    * Success heavily depends on the quality of document parsing, chunking, and the RAG implementation.
    * Handling diverse document formats and layouts effectively can be challenging.
    * Ensuring accurate and relevant answers from the GenAI requires careful prompt engineering and potentially fine-tuning.
    * Managing storage and processing for a large number of documents/users could present scalability challenges (though likely within course project limits).
    * The "novelty" might be in the specific implementation and focus, as general Q&A on documents is a known GenAI application.
