# LECture-bot React + Vite + TypeScript Project

This is a Vite-based frontend project using TypeScript and React for the LECture-bot application. You can run it either locally or using Docker.

## Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed. (Check client/package.json for specific version compatibilities if any are noted).

* The backend server (LECture-bot server) should be running and accessible, typically at <http://localhost:8080>, for API features to function correctly.

## üöÄ Running Locally

### 1. Navigate to Client Directory

If you are not already there:

```bash
cd client
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

(or yarn install if you prefer yarn)

### 3. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

(or yarn dev)

The app will typically be available at <http://localhost:5173> (as configured in client/vite.config.ts ).

## üß™ Testing Sign Up Functionality (UI)

Ensure both the backend server (e.g., on <http://localhost:8080>) and the frontend development server (e.g., on <http://localhost:5173>) are running.
Open your browser and navigate to the Sign Up page. The route for this page is `/signup`.

* URL: <http://localhost:5173/signup>
  * Fill in the registration form fields on the SignUpPage:
    * Name
    * Email
    * Password (min. 8 characters)
    * Confirm Password (must match password)
The form provides client-side validation feedback.

Upon submitting a valid form:

* A POST request is sent to <http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register>.
* **Successful Registration:** Expect a success message and redirection to the login page (e.g., /login).
* **Failed Registration:** Backend error messages (e.g., "Email already exists") should be displayed on the form.
* **CORS Note:** If CORS errors occur, verify the backend's SecurityConfig.java allows requests from <http://localhost:5173>.

## üê≥ Running with Docker

### 1. Build the Docker Image

Ensure you are in the client directory first.

```bash
docker build -t client-app .
```

### 2. Run the Docker Container

```bash
docker run --name client -p 3000:3000 client-app
```

The app will be available at <http://localhost:3000> when run via Docker with these commands.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building for Production

To create an optimized static build of the frontend:

```bash
npm run build
```

(or yarn build)

This typically outputs to a dist directory.

## ‚ú® Linting

To lint the codebase:

```bash
npm run lint
```

(or yarn lint)
